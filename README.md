## About This Project

TokenUI is built on top of our custom [token-extensions-boost](https://github.com/mocchaust64/token-extensions-boost) SDK, which simplifies working with Solana Token-2022 extensions. This SDK provides a comprehensive, developer-friendly interface for creating and managing tokens with advanced features like transfer fees, non-transferable tokens, and metadata extensions.

The combination of our simplified SDK and intuitive UI makes TokenUI one of the most accessible tools for working with Solana's next-generation token features, allowing both developers and non-technical users to leverage the full power of Token-2022.

## The SDK: token-extensions-boost

The TokenUI project is powered by our [token-extensions-boost](https://github.com/mocchaust64/token-extensions-boost) SDK, which provides:

- **Instructions-first API** - Seamless wallet integration without private key exposure
